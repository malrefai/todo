# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'


# macOS template
*.DS_Store
/.idea/
*.pyc

# Unit test / coverage reports
.coverage
/.pytest_cache/


# database
*.sqlite3
